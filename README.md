# SIC
This app is a android based sharing platform for non critical reusable medical devices

# Description :
Non critical reusable medical devices can be safely shared between different patients. Which can provide patients with the same benefits of newly purchased devices but with a much reduced cost. We propose to develop a web based platform that allows users to share and/or to search for reusable medical devices. It provide the users with the ability to add, search, the location of items, and the safety measure to be applied before reusing such an item. This web based platform can be accessed using a android smartphone application.
